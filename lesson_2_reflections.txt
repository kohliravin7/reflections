How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is like an intermediate stage. It is different from working directory because using this we can easily commit only the files on which we have made changes on. it is different from repository because a repo contains all the info about each and every commit whereas the staging area just has the files we want to commit
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	staging area helps in finding the changes we made since the last commit therefore we can verify them and 
	see if we have made a logical change or not

organised? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualise the branch structure?
	by making diagrams we can easily see which commit is reachable how and which branch starts from which commit
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
	One branch is deleted and the other branch now also points to the previous branch it kinda joins the tree.
