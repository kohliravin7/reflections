When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    	When i'd like other people to contribute to my project or maybe i am working from different devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	We may be working on some feature that is not ready for public yet, or maybe we are just experimenting with it.
