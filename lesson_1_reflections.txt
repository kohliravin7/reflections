How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	
	diff compared each line and created a - line for each line deleted and created a + line for each line added.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	
	so we can lookover the trivial tasks and concentrate on things that are important
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I have more control on when i want to commit. Although it would have been nice if a version is made automatically but 
    Its always subjective therefore with just a little effort we can decide when to commit and when not to commit.
    Choosing when to commit done should be done aptly.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	multiple file commit is necessary in git because it is mainly used for codes and a project usually has
	more than one file so we need to be able to track multiple files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log can be used to see a list of all the commits and git diff can be used to see the difference between a commit and its previous one therefore we can know all the updates made on the current commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Knowing that i can easily go back to any commit any time i'll be more confident in making changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
